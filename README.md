# Interceptor

disclaimer: So far just week-end/evenings experiment.

The code/design is heavily inspired from pedestal/sieparri.

It mimics pedestal interceptor behavior, but adds async lib agnostic
support with a default manifold impl.

Some minor differences with pedestal:

* no nested exceptions when :error handlers bubble up, no error wrapping either

* potential support for cljs easily achievable

* tiny codebase

* less is more: no :suppressed, :bindings, :terminators

## How it works:

It follows the interceptor pattern.

`execute` takes a context (map) and chains it to the "interceptors" .

An interceptor is just a map, with `:enter` key and potentially
`:leave` `:error` and `:name` (+ whatever you want to add).

`:enter` and `:leave` are function of the context and return a new
context. `:error` takes 2 arguments, the context and the error that
triggered it and return potentially a new context.

When you execute it will pass the context to the `:enter` handlers first,
they return a new updated context; then the `:leave` handlers in reverse
(if present).

Something like that:

``` text
enter A -> enter B -> enter C -> leave C -> leave B -> leave A

```

Upon encountering an error it will trigger the `:error` handler of the
interceptor that triggered it and if you rethrow or re-assoc the error
in the context it will let the error flow on the other :error handlers
in the stack.

## Manifold support

You can mix steps that return deferreds with normal steps like you
would do in chain it will work transparently.

note: if you use the normal execute the first interceptor will dict
the return value type (if it starts with a deferred you get a deferred
back). If you want to ensure you always get a deferred back no matter
what you can call `execute-deferred`

## Helpers

You can apply lenses/guards on handlers via `in` `out` `lens` `guard`
`discard` functions.

They are just middlewares to the handlers so you can apply them
separately to the handlers and have full control over their execution
order.

An interceptor can also just be a function. In that case it will just
be a step with a `:enter` key as itself.
